# Getting Started

- Download the repository to the desired folder on your desktop.

- Download to a separate folder UE4 source code (4.22 branch) with TrueSky Plugin in it: https://github.com/simul/UnrealEngine

- Run batch files and compile the engine via this instructions: https://docs.simul.co/unreal/source

- Launch the engine and open the Almaz project. It will ask you to open a copy (since the project was made in an older version of the engine) but force it to open the existing project without making a copy.

- Visual Studio 2017 with Windows SDK is required to be installed to open a project (it will generate and compile missing files)

# Notes

- `git push` has a limit of 100Mb per file and 1Gb per push. When manually uploading using Github.com it has limits 25Mb per file and 100 files per one upload

- Github recommends keeping the repository size under 1Gb, but [apparently](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota) the actual size could be under 100Gb

- Source control in UE4 allows to check out (lock from editing by another user) and check in files and also make commits for certain files directly from the editor. More info: https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/UI/SourceControl/index.html
